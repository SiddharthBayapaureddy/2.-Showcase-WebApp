# Project Showcase Website/ Portfolio Website

## What is this project?
### In this project, I built a website, where I've displayed all my current projects that I've built. I included the name, a picture, and a link of the source code to the github repository of my project. 

## What did I use?
### Streamlit - It's a python library, used for designing and building websites or web apps. It's user and beginner friendly to work with. I've made two pages in the website, one home page dispaying my projects in 2 columns, and another 'Contact Me' oage, where users can send a mail to me about any suggestions, doubts etc.,
### pandas - For the project name, picture and source code, I didn't manually type it all out each time. I iterated through the CSV file containing all data using pandas library, and integrated it with streamlit for changes on the website. So in future I've to add a new project, I can simply add the data in the CSV file instead of changing the code. 
### smtplib, ssl and os - Used these for making a Gmail app, and made a new environment variable containing my app password.
